                    At the heart of the Mercedes-AMG G 63 is the legendary 4.0-litre V8 biturbo engine with 430 kW (585
                    hp) and 850 Nm of torque. This has been coupled with a starter generator
                    for the first time and boasts even more explosive power delivery and breathtaking torque.</p>

                <p>Gelandewagen
                    Ever wondered what the “G” in the G-Class stands for? It surely isn't just a letter that
                    Mercedes-Benz assigns to different models in its lineup. It stands for “Gelandewagen”, which means
                    cross country vehicle.
                    This is why it is also commonly known as simply G-wagen, which is just a short form of the name.</p>

                <p>If you don't giggle like a child while driving a G63, you probably have no soul. The G63 is also a
                    lot better on a
                    long road trip than you'd expect. Even with 22-inch wheels the ride is pretty damn good, and the
                    front seats are supportive and highly adjustable</p>
